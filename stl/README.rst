Volumetric flowrate sensor STL models
=====================================

Here are some 3D models for the ddPrint flowrate sensor.

Base FRS model is always the same. It is combined with different inlet- and outlet-adapters.

The inlet is where the FRS is mouted at the feeder, possible feeders are:

* UM2: the old (black) Ultimaker 2 feeder.
* E3D: E3D adapter (for example on the Titan feeder), used on BMG style feeders too.
* M6: FRS is connected to the feeder using a short piece of a M6 heatbreak, for example
  Ender or Anycubic i3m.

The outlet side of the FRS is where the filament bowden tube is connected. It is a hole where
a M6 or M10 pneumatic coupler (pushfit) is screwd in.
